I had a Raspberry Pi 2 sitting aroung unused. Since I also had a couple of Bose speaker that sound nice I wanted to find something to stream web radio. Potentially to also do Airplay.

[Pi MusicBox](http://www.pimusicbox.com/) delivered just that. Webradio and Airplay support.
_I actually got this setup a while ago. Streaming was working, Airplay not so much. Today I decided to mess around with the setup. As a result the Pi doesnâ€™t seem to boot properly_

## Setup
- Rasbberry Pi
- Edimax WiFi dongle 
- Small poweradapter incl. USB cable
- Bose speakers with analog audio cable
- _Note: I did not use a fancy USB Soundcard as most people suggest. To me the output is sufficient and there is no cracking whatsoever_
