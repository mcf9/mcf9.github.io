I had a Raspberry Pi 2 sitting aroung unused. Since I also had a couple of Bose speaker that sound nice I wanted to find something to stream web radio. Potentially to also do Airplay.

[Pi MusicBox](http://www.pimusicbox.com/) delivered just that. Webradio and Airplay support.

Everything ~~is~~ was cool. Somehow I managed to mess up the configuration and now the Pi won’t boot properly. Thus I have to redo the setup.

## Setup
- Rasbberry Pi
- Edimax WiFi dongle 
- Small poweradapter incl. USB cable
- 16GB SD Card
- Bose speakers with analog audio cable
- _Note: I did not use a fancy USB Soundcard as most people suggest. To me the output is sufficient and there is no cracking whatsoever_

You can setup MusicBox manually, but I’ll just use the provided [SD-Card image](https://dl.mopidy.com/pimusicbox/pimusicbox-0.6.0.zip).
